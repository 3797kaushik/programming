This enables developers to create powerful applications which can publish a blog, remotely control hardware, or run a powerful website such as Wikipedia or <a href='files/pdf/photograph.pdf' target='_blank'><b>Wikibooks</b></a> Of course, to accomplish something such as this, you need a database application such as MySQL.</p>
