    The first version of P &nbsp;&nbsp;HP was named Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) when it was released by <b>Rasmus Lerdorf</b> in 1995. PHP 1 can still be downloaded today from museum.php.net. Weighing in at only 26 kilobytes in size, php-108.tar.gz is diminutive by today's standards, yet it was capable of allowing users to implement guestbooks and other form-processing applications.

    By January 2013, PHP was being used by a remarkable <b><u>244M sites</u></b>, meaning that 39% of sites in Netcraft's Web Server Survey were running PHP. Of that run PHP, 78% are served from Linux computers, followed by 8% on FreeBSD. Precompiled Windows binaries can also be downloaded from windows.php.net, which has helped Windows account for over 7% of PHP sites.<br>
